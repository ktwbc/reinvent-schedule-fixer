The purpose of this extension is to color the AWS Reinvent schedule so you can see where the heck the sessions are. I've put this a a suggestion to AWS numerous times and finally got fed up with waiting.
- Captures the schedule information from the API
- Applies colors by using the venue name as a CSS class
- Appends the Venue to the DIV of each section


This extension doesn't collect any user and web page information. It only runs on The AWS Re:Invent MyAgenda page. It is free to use, but you're free to buy me a coffee at https://buymeacoffee.com/kristhomwh8 if you find this useful!
