Re:Invent Schedule Fixer
========================

This is a Google Chrome extension. You can install this extension by this address: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reinvent-schedule-fixer/uploadpendinghash).

The purpose of this extension is to add additional display features to the AWS Re:Invent MyAgenda Scheduler page to make planning your schedule easier.

This extension doesn't collect any user and web page information. It only runs on AWS My Agenda web page. It is free to use.

The list of sessions is using browser memory (AWS did this not me) so some browser memory is used during searching. There is a purposeful 3 second delay before modifying the page to allow everything to load.
